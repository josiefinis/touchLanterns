# BUGFIX

## Issue 
Candle 0 turns on and off without being touched.
Happens sometimes without any input to any candle, i.e. is found to be on at random times. 
Happens more often when there is input to another candle.
Can interrupt long press to other sensors.

Possibly also on candle by headphones (index 8?)


## Cause
Presumably issue with capacitive sensing.
Maybe due to correct reading of unwanted elevated capacitance, e.g. from interference between sensors.
Maybe a bug in 'Sensor' class.
Could be significant that it affects index 0 (first in Sensor.output loop).
Also if affecting index 8 (last in Sensor.output loop).
Maybe something to do with the Sensor.output loop being interrupted?


## Action
Monitor capacitance (sensor input) to see if it is a correct reading of unwanted elevated capacitance. If so, make 'Sensor' class more robust.
Try changing loop end condition
  > while ( muxChannel % 16 != 0 );
to break on a different index and observe if the problem moves to that index. If so, look for bug in 'Sensor' class.
