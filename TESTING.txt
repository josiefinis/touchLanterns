# Testing Branch

## TODO

* Investigate why lanterns get "frozen out".
    - Lanterns don't respond to touch.
    - Seems to be after root AUTO event.
    - The root lantern does respond to touch, and triggers all others to follow.
    - Likely that lanterns are failing to leave tree and yet are in IDLE state.
    - Not seen it happen after root FULL event.
    - Test fix in branch 'fix'.
    - Tested. Working.

* Test burnDown
    - Need to run test over a long time period.
