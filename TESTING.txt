# Testing Branch

## Fixes

* Make sensor input more robust to stray capacitance when standing on floor in socks. Change normalisation factor? Get highest.
* Change handling of new root state when a tree already exists. i.e. after ROOT_AUTO have to wait for all lanterns to finish adjusting their brightness before allowing ROOT_AUTO again. Should instead start a new tree. Need to destroy the existing tree first.


tree class?
