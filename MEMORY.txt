# MEMORY BRANCH - Manage memory better.

    It is likely that a memory issue has caused the program to hang. Specifically heap fragmentation caused by dynamic memory allocation of the PWM queue.
    Have changed the queue implementation in PWM to an array, which now takes up a bunch of space as a global variable on the stack.
    This is presumably better than it being on the heap but can maybe do better.
    Should also look at memory use by the rest of the program.

## Actions
    * Learn more about Arduino memory, continue reading here https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/programming/memory-guide 
    * Avoid dynamic memory allocation.
      - Look into changing queue and linked list implementation.
        * queue in makeTree
         - not used outside of makeTree, can this be done roughly as is but on the stack?
        * neighbour list
          - change to array
          - is constant, but want to shuffle and have quick access on occasion makeTree is called
          - can maybe put in program memory and copy to RAM in advance when needed.

    * Reduce memory used by global variables on stack.
      - neighbour list, see above.
      - clean up old code
      - streamline Lantern class maybe
